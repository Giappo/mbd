alpha_conditional_probability(brts, pars, alpha, tips_interval = c(0,
  Inf), cond = 1, soc = 2, methode = "expo", abstol = 1e-16,

}
\arguments{
\item{brts}{A set of branching times of a phylogeny.}

\item{pars}{vector of parameters:
\itemize{
  \item pars[1] is the multiple speciation trigger rate;
  \item pars[2] is the extinction rate;
  \item pars[3] is the single-lineage speciation probability.
}
or
\itemize{
  \item pars[1] is lambda, the sympatric speciation rate;
  \item pars[2] is mu, the extinction rate;
  \item pars[3] is nu, the multiple allopatric speciation trigger rate;
  \item pars[4] is q, the single-lineage speciation probability.
}}

\item{alpha}{something}

\item{tips_interval}{Sets tips boundaries constrain on simulated dataset.
You can also define the tips_interval as you can usually 
do with a standard usage of mbd_sim.}

\item{cond}{Set 1 if you want to condition on stem or crown age 
and non-extinction of the phylogeny. Set 0 otherwise.}

\item{soc}{Sets whether stem or crown age should be used (1 or 2).}
